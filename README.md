A final project for CS171

The library functions we used in this project included:
bootstrap.min.js, d3.min.js, d3.tip.js, ext-jquery-ui.min.js, jquery.min.js, jquery.min.map, jquery1.js, jqueryui.js,
queue.min.js, topojson.js, bootstrap.min.css, ext-jquery.css, and jquery.css

barchart.js makes the barchart function
- Daniel.js makes the intraseason line graph function
- linechart.js lets the interseason line graph function
- main.js loads our data and coordinates our functions
- map.js makes the map function
- matrix_object.js allows the matrix to function
- slider.js allows the slider to work
- teamcolors.js allows us to use linechart colors that match the team colors.
- styles.css dictates our style choices

The files in data have different types of data formatted for each specific visualization

The potentially non olbvious features of our project include:
- Being able to click on team logos to change what is visible on the interseason line graph
- Being able to zoom in on the map
- Being able to change all of the graphs with the timeline in the top right corner
- Being able to click on the dots on the intraseason graph to make them larger, highlight them, highlight a box in the
matrix, pull up the game data next to the matrix.
- Being able to click on a score of a game in the matrix to pull up more information on it and highlight the dots on the
intraseason data above
- Being able to mouseover the bargraphs bars to highlight specific teams on the intraseason line graph
